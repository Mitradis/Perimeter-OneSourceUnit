# Perimeter-OneSourceUnit
Perimeter good game but has outdated methods of confusing gameplay. One of which is the 3 initial units from which all others are created. This is extremely inconvenient and requires the player to constantly count their number. Nobody will deal with this nonsense now.  
This program automatically replaces the required lines in AI files and mission files making unit creation only require one type of source unit - soldiers.  
This does not change the original difficulty of the game. This doesn't make creating units any cheaper. This doesn't make the AI any easier. All requirements in general quantities remain the same. All missions in the company are working as usual.  
For use you can apply ready files or place TextReplacer.exe in to the game directory for change Triggers and Missions files.
